Hello, I'm **Chao GAO**.  

I'm going to be a backend engineer in ByteDance, Shanghai. Before that, I obtained a bachelor and master degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018 and 2021, respectively. During the period of my graduate study, I did some research on the optimization of query processing algorithms towards high dimensional data.
